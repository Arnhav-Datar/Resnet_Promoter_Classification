# Resnet Promoter Classification

The reliable detection and classification of promoters in DNA remains a challenging task even
today. Recent advances in this field consist mainly, of the application of deep-learning techniques
to solve this problem. We propose some modifications to a state-of-the-art deep-learning-based
approach (by Amin et. al.) used to identify and classify Ïƒ-promoters in the genome of E. coli.
We use the large training set used by the original authors, and test our model on an independent
test set. We obtain a test accuracy of 89.84%. We furthermore do an analysis of our results
using a confusion matrix to find for which classes the model is not performing up to the mark
and how it can be improved.
